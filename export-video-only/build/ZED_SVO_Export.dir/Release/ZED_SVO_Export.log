  Building Custom Rule C:/Users/tt2736/Documents/Visual Studio 2015/Projects/export/CMakeLists.txt
  CMake is re-running because C:/Users/tt2736/Documents/Visual Studio 2015/Projects/export/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp dependency file is missing.
  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:6 (cmake_policy):
    The OLD behavior for policy CMP0003 will be removed from a future version
    of CMake.
  
    The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
    policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
    specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
    behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
